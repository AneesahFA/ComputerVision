  <h1>Welcome to My Computer Vision Project Portfolio</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores the fascinating field of <strong>Computer Vision</strong> — a branch of AI that enables machines to interpret and process visual data. It spans historical milestones, breakthrough technologies like deep learning, and real-world applications across healthcare, agriculture, defense, and more. Computer Vision is one of the most practical and transformative applications of artificial intelligence today. It allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual input, such as images or video, just like humans do. For instance, tools like Google Lens use computer vision to analyze what your camera sees and return context aware results. You can identify plants, scan QR codes, translate text in real time, or find similar products online just by pointing your phone. Similarly, on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, when you tap and hold an object in a photo, the phone uses advanced object segmentation and recognition to isolate the subject, then offers options to search the web or interact with it. These experiences are powered by a combination of deep learning, edge AI, and sophisticated image processing, all under the umbrella of computer vision. This project highlights how these capabilities are built and used across industries, from mobile apps to medical diagnostics and smart city systems.</p>
